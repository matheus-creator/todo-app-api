# To-do App - Api

This is a repository for the server side of the to-do app, which was built in Node.js.

The main features that were implemented are: password hashing, authentication based on cookies, generated with JWT, and data storage with PostgreSQL.

Talking about the database, it was chosen to use one in the cloud, through Heroku.

To run the code, it is necessary to define some environment variables (```.env``` file):

- PORT: server port
- JWT_SECRET: secret to generate and validate tokens used on cookies
- CLIENT_URL: url of front-end
- DATABASE_URL: connection string of database generated by Heroku. If you want to run this locally, just pass your database information following the model of the ```pg``` package ([docs](https://node-postgres.com/features/connecting))

Unfortunately, it was not possible to deploy neither front-end nor back-end, since the only free host indefinitely, Heroku, does not allow that a server set cookies in the browser without a private domain. Therefore, it was chosen to keep the code running locally.
